## Fermi Pico Nano Guessing game

This is the Fermi, Pico, Nano guessing game written in Java.

How it works:
• Fermi : one number is a target number and is in the right position
• Pico : one number is a target number but is not in right position
• Nano : one number is not a target number

For testing/example purposes the answer is printed out when the game first starts.

When all 3 numbers are in the right position the game will tell you that you have won and will tell you how many guesses it took you to win!
Once the game is completed or you cannot figure out the right combination of numbers you can simply click the restart button and the game will
then generate another set of 3 random numbers.
